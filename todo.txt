is moving
increment
reading position
needs to calculate safe path based on where it is
winder class with pos, velocity, wire number
optional arguments for moving to particular position
excel sheet tolerance calculation

go to wire n instead
have a look up table and then find safe path

winder class with:
  position
  velocity
  
  move y: specific case of move
  move x: specific case of move
  is moving

to do:
constant updating of position
expand outside zone 1
expand outside of v layer
optional x command

Questions:
-Zone 1 rhs? yes, zone 1 always closest to head
-no wire because US_APA_1 not loaded?
    wire number should just be a state
    wire num doesnt readout unless you have apa and layer loaded, we dont want to require this
-what is the "tolerance" on being on a wire?
    doesnt have tolerance, just based on stepping through wires
